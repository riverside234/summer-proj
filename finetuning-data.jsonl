The routine should be structured into three parts: a 2-minute dynamic warm-up, a 6-minute main workout consisting of bodyweight exercises, and a 2-minute cool-down stretch. \n\nEnsure that:\n- The exercises are safe and can be performed in a limited office space without disturbing colleagues.\n- You provide variations for different fitness levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced).\n- Accurate, domain-specific terminology is used, such as \"dynamic stretch,\" \"bodyweight exercise,\" and \"cool-down stretch.\"\n- Each exercise is clearly described with step-by-step instructions and includes the number of repetitions or the duration of each.\n- The information is presented using bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.\n\nFirst, explain the principles behind your exercise selection and sequence. Afterward, provide the detailed routine.\n\n### Explanation of Principles:\n1. **Dynamic Warm-Up (2 minutes):**\n   - Designed to increase blood flow and prepare the muscles for physical activity.\n   - Includes movements that mimic the main workout exercises to enhance mobility.\n\n2. **Main Workout (6 minutes):**\n   - Focuses on compound bodyweight exercises that engage multiple muscle groups.\n   - High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) approach to maximize calorie burn and cardiovascular benefits in a short time.\n\n3. **Cool-Down Stretch (2 minutes):**\n   - Aims to relax the muscles and gradually lower the heart rate.\n   - Incorporates static stretching to improve flexibility and reduce the risk of injury.\n\n### Detailed Routine:\n#### Dynamic Warm-Up (2 minutes):\n1. **Arm Circles:**\n   - Extend arms to the sides and make small circles forward for 30 seconds.\n   - Reverse direction and make small circles backward for 30 seconds.\n2. **High Knees:**\n   - Run in place, lifting knees to waist height for 1 minute.\n\n#### Main Workout (6 minutes):\n1. **Squats:**\n   - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, lower into a squat, and return to standing.\n   - Perform 15 squats (beginner), 20 squats (intermediate), 25 squats (advanced).\n2. **Push-Ups:**\n   - Begin in a plank position, lower the body until the chest nearly touches the floor, and push back up.\n   - Perform 10 push-ups (beginner), 15 push-ups (intermediate), 20 push-ups (advanced).\n3. **Lunges:**\n   - Step one foot forward into a lunge, lowering the back knee towards the floor, then return to standing.\n   - Perform 10 lunges per leg (beginner), 15 lunges per leg (intermediate), 20 lunges per leg (advanced).\n4. **Plank:**\n   - Hold a plank position with forearms on the ground and body in a straight line.\n   - Hold for 30 seconds (beginner), 45 seconds (intermediate), 1 minute (advanced).\n5. **Jumping Jacks:**\n   - Start with feet together and arms at your sides, jump to a star position and return.\n   - Perform for 1 minute (all levels).\n\n#### Cool-Down Stretch (2 minutes):\n1. **Forward Bend:**\n   - Stand with feet together, bend forward at the hips, and reach for the toes while keeping the knees slightly bent.\n   - Hold for 1 minute.\n2. **Shoulder Stretch:**\n   - Extend one arm across the body and gently press with the opposite hand to stretch the shoulder.\n   - Hold each side for 30 seconds. \n\nEnsure clear instructions and proper variations to cater to different fitness levels.<|eot_id|>\n    "}
